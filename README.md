# PHYS142
Code examples for PHYS 142: Electricity &amp; Magnetism (Honors)

## Description
Programming problems will be provided for extra credit on HW assignments during the course. While all the examples provided here are in Python, students may wish to use other languages such as Julia, Mathematica, and Matlab. These are allowed, though technical support will be limited to Python.

You may work on programming problems with others, but submitted code must be your own. If you worked with others, indicate who you worked with. You will not be graded on your coding style or the efficiency of your implementations, but to ensure you get credit, your submitted code should be neat and include comments and reasonably named functions and variables.

## Useful Resources
